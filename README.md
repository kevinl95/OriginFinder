A modern web application to help you better identify where products come from during your errands! It lets you scan the barcodes on products using your cell phone camera and then uses the UPC to tell you where the product is coming from. It does this entirely offline- you can visit this page while you have internet and then re-visit the page while avoidng spotty or non-existant supermarket internet and still be able to see where your products are coming from!
